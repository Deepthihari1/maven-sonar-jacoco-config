Base configuration to use sonar with jacoco in a multi-module project.  

Note: Sonar can't display IT coverage per module in a multi-module project.  
So current configuration just displays the aggregate IT coverage of all modules.

Runs in 2 stages for use with jenkins: 
mvn -Pprepare-for-sonar verify
mvn -Psonar sonar:sonar
