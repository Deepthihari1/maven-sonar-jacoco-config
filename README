Base configuration to use sonar with jacoco in a multi-module project.  

TODO: IT coverage doesn't work in multi-module projects.  Sonar seems to only 
check the root level location. 
Possible hack would be to use ant to merge all available reports into root level 
location.

Run with: mvn -Psonar verify sonar:sonar
